# zomato-food-delivery-restaurant-aggregator-data-analysis
Data analysis on India's largest online restaurant aggregator and food delivery service, Zomato. 

Please open the notebook file (.ipynb extension) in Jupyter, Pycharm or any other notebook compatible software and make sure you have all the python packages mentioned in the notebook installed on your system. 
Github doesn't allow uploading large files, hence I couldn't upload the zomato dataset. Please download the dataset from my GDrive link ->> https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1-hGBKsqakxhaUMCYKeP_41PLixiUGgc6?usp=sharing

I have described about Zomato's business, the business problem, the solution and my insights in the notebook.
I will explain my projects in great details with good graphics and code snippets once I finish building my portfolio and blog website.
